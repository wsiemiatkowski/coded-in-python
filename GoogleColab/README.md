# Google Colab
## Overview
### Source
Jupyter notebooks present in this directory are a result of my courses on computer simulations and machine learning
during my engineering degree in computer science. It's at this point that I first got excited about AI and working
with data.
### Language
The notebooks are written in Polish as a result of my courses being in Polish. Most of them feature pictures or diagrams
making them readable despite the language barrier.
### Google Colab
Content of this directory have been entirely made using Google's Colab service. Requirements for those notebooks may not
match this repository's `requirments.txt` as they all have their own installation cells.
